The Matrix Multiplication Benchmark compares the performance of matrix
multiplication between Python and Cython implementations. Matrix multiplication
is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and is often used in various
computational tasks.

This benchmark measures the execution time of multiplying two matrices of a
specified size using both Python and Cython implementations. By comparing the
execution times, we can determine which implementation performs matrix
multiplication more efficiently.

The benchmark utilizes NumPy for matrix operations and Cython for optimizing
the Cython implementation. It generates random matrices, performs matrix
multiplication using the Python and Cython functions, and calculates the
speedup percentage to demonstrate the performance improvement achieved by
Cython.

By running this benchmark, you can gain insights into the performance
differences between Python and Cython when it comes to matrix multiplication
tasks. It helps identify the potential speedup that Cython can provide and
evaluate the efficiency of the implementations for various matrix sizes.
