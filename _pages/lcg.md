The LCG (Linear Congruential Generator) Benchmark is a comparison between the Python and Cython implementations of the LCG algorithm. The LCG is a simple pseudorandom number generator that generates a sequence of numbers based on a linear equation.

This benchmark measures the performance of generating a specified number of random numbers using both the Python and Cython implementations. The execution times of the two implementations are compared to determine which one is faster. Additionally, the speedup percentage is calculated to show the improvement in performance achieved by using Cython.

By running this benchmark, you can gain insights into the performance differences between Python and Cython when it comes to generating random numbers using the LCG algorithm.
